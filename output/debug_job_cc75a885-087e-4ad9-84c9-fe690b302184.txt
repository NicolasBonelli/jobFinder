Moventi is a technology-driven company committed to helping organizations lead with innovation by leveraging advanced technologies. We cultivate a collaborative and multidisciplinary environment that encourages continuous learning, skill development, and sharing of experiences among professionals. Our office is centrally located and designed to foster teamwork and creativity through agile workstations and recreational areas.

Postula √∫nicamente desde getonbrd.com.
Role and Responsibilities
As a full-stack developer in our engineering team, you will be responsible for the entire lifecycle of back-end systems powering our microservices platform in a cloud environment. Your tasks will include designing, building, and extending APIs that serve both mobile and web applications.
You will collaborate closely with mobile engineers to ensure seamless integration and will develop ReactJS screens that consume these APIs. Working remotely with colleagues in the United States and Prague, you will engage in effective communication and teamwork to deliver quality software solutions.
Additionally, you will uphold best engineering practices including security, automated testing, and version control. The role requires flexibility to work core hours with occasional evenings for major sporting events, reflecting the startup-like culture we maintain.
Required Skills and Experience
At least 4 years of professional experience developing API-driven applications at scale.
A degree in computer science or equivalent practical experience in software engineering.
Mastery of Node.js development using TypeScript, delivering robust and scalable back-end services.
Proficient with ReactJS and its relevant frameworks to build high-quality front-end experiences.
Strong understanding and practical experience with relational databases and SQL for efficient data management.
Experience building scalable applications within cloud environments, preferably with AWS and its underlying services.
Expertise in automated testing approaches ensuring high-quality code, along with Git version control proficiency and familiarity with relevant development tools.
Exceptional troubleshooting and debugging capabilities to dissect and resolve complex system issues methodically.
Excellent communication skills suited for an entirely remote and globally dispersed team, enabling productive collaboration and transparency.
Self-driven attitude with a strong work ethic and enthusiasm for tackling technical challenges.
Ability to design systems thoughtfully, balancing extensibility and necessary trade-offs to meet user needs and business goals effectively.
Comfort working in a dynamic, startup-like environment with core working hours and occasional extra hours to support major events.
An eagerness to adopt and push boundaries with the latest AI tools and technologies to enhance developer and team productivity.
Preferred Qualifications and Skills
While not mandatory, familiarity with specific cloud services on AWS would be advantageous, allowing smoother infrastructure integration and scalability. Experience working with distributed teams in a remote, multicultural environment will enable faster adaptation and stronger collaboration. Additional knowledge of modern front-end frameworks beyond ReactJS or contribution to open-source projects would be a plus, demonstrating passion and continual professional growth. Understanding DevOps practices and CI/CD pipelines would further benefit the role by improving deployment efficiency and reliability. Finally, a keen interest in leveraging artificial intelligence technologies to optimize software development processes will align well with our innovation-driven culture.
Benefits and Work Environment
At Moventi, we provide a stimulating and collaborative work environment located in a central city area with convenient parking and relaxation areas for breaks and creative brainstorming. Our office features agile workstations designed to promote teamwork among professionals from diverse profiles, enhancing knowledge exchange and innovation.
This role offers the opportunity to grow professionally by working on impactful technology projects with a supportive global team. While the position is fully remote, our cultural values and collaborative tools ensure team cohesion and personal development.
